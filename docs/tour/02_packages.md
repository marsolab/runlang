# Packages

In Run, packages are a way to organize your code into logical groups.

## Package main

Programs start it's execution in package main.

This program is using the packages with import paths "fmt" and "math/rand".

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. For instance, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand.
