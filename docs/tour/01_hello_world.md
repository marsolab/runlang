# Hello World

Here is a tiny program that prints out the text "Hello, World!". We'll explain how it works shortly.

In a normal Run project this program would be run using the command `run` on the command line, but here in this tour the program is compiled and run inside your web browser, allowing you to try Run without installing anything on your computer.

Try changing the text being printed to Hello, World! and see what happens.

```run
package main

use "fmt"

pub fun main() {
    fmt.println("Hello, World!")
}
```
